1.In Knight Rider, why does each LED require its own pin?
  Each LED lights up separately. Each pin will give each LED that was connect corresponding comands(code).

2.Why is Knight Rider 2 in the Arduino tutorial so much shorter than Knight Rider 1?
  Beacause the Knight Rider use the for loop, that simplfy all the repeat codes.

3.What resistor value should be used with the LEDs?
  470 ohm resistor (yellow - violet - brown), R1, 1/4W, 5% or better for the resisitor.
